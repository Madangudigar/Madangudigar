1. Micro purchased an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got bored of it and decided to update value of its element. In one second he can increase value of each array element by 1. He wants each array element's value to become greater than or equal to K. Please help Micro to find out the minimum amount of time it will take, for him to do so. 
 


2.Students have become secret admirers of SEGP. They find the course exciting and the professors amusing. After a superb Mid Semester examination, it’s now time for the results.

5.Monk watching fight
Once Monk was watching a fight between an array and a tree, of being better. Tree
got frustrated and converted that array into a Binary Search Tree by inserting the
elements as nodes in BST, processing elements in the given order in the array. Now
Monk wants to know the height of the created Binary Search Tree.
Help Monk for the same.
Note:
1) In Binary Search Tree, the left sub-tree contains only nodes with values less than
or equal to the parent node; the right sub-tree contains only nodes with values
greater than the parent node.
2) Binary Search Tree with one node, has height equal to 1.
Input Format
The first line will consist of 1 integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
In next line, there will be N space separated integers, A[i], where 1 ≤ I ≤ N, denoting
the elements of array.
Output Format
Print the height of the created Binary Search Tree.
